## 2024-05-23 - Clear Button on Large Text Input
**Learning:** For recovery tools where users are expected to paste large, sensitive strings (like keys or seed phrases), a dedicated "Clear" button is a critical usability feature. It allows users to quickly reset the state without manually selecting and deleting text, which can be error-prone and frustrating on mobile or with large payloads.
**Action:** When implementing large text areas for data entry, always consider adding a "Clear" action if the input is expected to be replaced frequently or entirely.
